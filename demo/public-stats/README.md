# Certified statics for COVID-19 mortality rate

Code accompannying the paper "smkhls: Succinct Multi Key Linearly Homomorphic Signatures for Certified Statistics", which shows how smklhs can be used to certify linear function evaluations in a dataset with succint proofs.

For building the code, run `make` inside the source directory. This will build the `main` binary to test, benchmark and print different mortality metrics.

WARNING: This is an academic proof of concept, and in particular has not received code review. This implementation is NOT ready for any type of production use.
