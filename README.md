RELIC is a modern research-oriented cryptographic meta-toolkit with emphasis on efficiency and flexibility. RELIC can be used to build efficient and usable cryptographic toolkits tailored for specific security levels and algorithmic choices.

### Goals

RELIC is an ongoing project and features will be added on demand. The focus is to provide:

 * Ease of portability and inclusion of architecture-dependent code
 * Simple experimentation with alternative implementations
 * Tests and benchmarks for every implemented function
 * Flexible configuration
 * Maximum efficiency

### Algorithms

RELIC implements to date:

 * Multiple-precision integer arithmetic
 * Prime and Binary field arithmetic
 * Elliptic curves over prime and binary fields (NIST curves and pairing-friendly curves)
 * Bilinear maps and related extension fields
 * Cryptographic protocols (RSA, Rabin, ECDSA, ECMQV, ECSS (Schnorr), ECIES, Sakai-Ohgishi-Kasahara ID-based authenticated key agreement, Boneh-Lynn-Schacham and Boneh-Boyen short signatures, Paillier and Benaloh homomorphic encryption systems)
 * [**Non-interactive Inner-product arguments**](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/relic-379B/src/cp/relic_cp_ipa.c) in the style of Bulletproofs
 * [**Succint Multi-Key Linearly Homomorphic Signatures**](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/relic-379B/src/cp/relic_cp_smklhs.c) for [**certified statistics**](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/relic-379B/demo/public-stats)

### Licensing

This work is dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 and LGPL 2.1-or-above to encourage collaboration with other research groups and contributions from the industry. You can choose between one of them if you use this work.

### Disclaimer

RELIC is at best alpha-quality software. Implementations may not be correct or secure and may include patented algorithms. There are *many* configuration options which make the library horribly insecure. Backward API compatibility with early versions may not necessarily be maintained. Side-channel and fault injection attacks are not considered in particular, unless it is explicitly noted. Use at your own risk.
