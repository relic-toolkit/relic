==Current tasks before next release==

 * Find a solution for const-correct extension field arithmetic (structs?)
 * Carefully review RSA padding code, check length when digestInfo needs to be inserted and make padding scheme decided on runtime.
 * Implement HMAC-DRBG when HMAC is considered stable.
